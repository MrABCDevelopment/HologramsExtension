<p align="center">Hey, this is <b>HologramsExtension</b> which adds cooldown information as hologram above chest! Is it hard to configure? No! It's really simple! You have <b>config.yml</b> where you set all values! <b>Remember!</b> Before you start your server with this extension, you have to use HolographicDisplays plugin (3.0.0+).</p>

<p align="center">There's not too much to say, you have to:
<ul><li>Put this extension to <b>RandomLootChest/extensions</b> directory</li>
  <li>Start the server</li>
  <li>If you want to configure, just stop the server and setup all values in <b>RandomLootChest/HologramsExtension/config.yml</b></li>
  <li>After configuration, just start server and have fun!</li></p>
